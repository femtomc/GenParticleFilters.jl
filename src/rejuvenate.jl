Rejuvenates particles by repeated application of a kernel `kern`. `kern`
should be a callable which takes a trace as its first argument, and returns
a tuple with a trace as the first return value. `method` specifies the
rejuvenation method: `:move` for MCMC moves without a reweighting step,
and `:reweight` for rejuvenation with a reweighting step.

Rejuvenates particles by repeated application of a MCMC kernel `kern`. `kern`

a tuple `(trace, accept)`, where `trace` is the (potentially) new trace, and
`accept` is true if the MCMC move was accepted. Subsequent arguments to `kern`
can be supplied with `kern_args`. The kernel is repeatedly applied to each trace
for `n_iters`.

"""
    pf_move_reweight!(state::ParticleFilterState, kern,
                      kern_args::Tuple=(), n_iters::Int=1)

Rejuvenates and reweights particles by repeated application of a reweighting
kernel `kern`, as described in [1]. `kern` should be a callable which takes a
trace as its first argument, and returns a tuple `(trace, rel_weight)`,
where `trace` is the new trace, and `rel_weight` is the relative log-importance
weight. Subsequent arguments to `kern` can be supplied with `kern_args`.
The kernel is repeatedly applied to each trace for `n_iters`, and the weights
accumulated accordingly. Both the [`move_reweight`](@ref) function and
[symmetric trace translators](https://www.gen.dev/stable/ref/trace_translators/)
can serve as reweighting kernels.

Move-reweight MCMC kernel, which takes in a `trace` and returns a new trace
along with a relative importance weight. This can be used for rejuvenation
within a particle filter, as described in [1].

Several variants of `move_reweight` exist, differing in the complexity
involved in proposing and re-weighting random choices:

1. The `selection` variant regenerates the addresses specified by `selection`
   using the model's default proposal.
2. A `proposal` generative function and arguments can be provided, to propose
   new random choices using a custom proposal distribution. `proposal` must
   take the original trace as its first input argument.
3. An `involution` can also be provided, to handle more complex proposal
   distributions which add/remove trace addresses.
4. Separate forward and backward proposal distributions, `proposal_fwd` and
   `proposal_bwd`, can be provided, as long they share the same support. This
   adjusts the computation of the relative importance weight by scoring
   the backward choices under the backward proposal.
