Perform a particle filter update, where the model arguments are adjusted and
new observations are conditioned upon. New latent choices are sampled from a
custom `proposal` distribution in conjuction with the model's default proposal.
For each particle:
* `proposal` is evaluated with arguments `(t_old, proposal_args...)`,
   where `t_old` is the old model trace, and produces its own trace `t_prop`.
* The old model trace is replaced by a new model trace `t_new`, constructed
  by merging the choices in `t_old` and `t_prop`, and sampling any remaining
  choices from the model's default proposal.

The choicemap of `t_new` satisfies the following conditions:
1. `observations` is a subset of `get_choices(t_new)`;
2. `get_choices(t_old)` is a subset of `get_choices(t_new)`;
3. `get_choices(t_prop)` is a subset of `get_choices(t_new)`.
where one choicemap `a` is a "subset" of another choicemap `b`, when all keys
that occur in `a` also occur in `b`, and the values at those addresses are
equal. It is an error if no trace `t_new` satisfying the above conditions
exists in the support of the model (with the new arguments).

Perform a particle filter update, with a custom forward and backward kernel.
New latent choices are sampled from 'fwd_proposal', and any discarded choices
are evaluated under `bwd_proposal`. For each particle:
* `fwd_proposal` is evaluated with arguments `(t_old, fwd_args...)`,
   where `t_old` is the old model trace, and produces its own trace `t_fwd`.
* The old model trace is replaced by a new model trace `t_new`, constructed
  by merging the choices in `t_old` and `t_fwd`, sampling any remaining
  choices from the model's default proposal, and discarding `disc_choices`,
  the choices in `t_old` inconsistent with those in `t_fwd`.
* The probability of `disc_choices` is assessed under `bwd_proposal` with the
  arguments `(t_new, bwd_args)`, giving a backward weight. This weight is used
  as a correction within the importance weight update, ensuring that the
  particle filter remains a valid approximation of the posterior.

The choicemap of `t_new` and `disc_choices` satisfy the following conditions:
1. `observations` is a subset of `get_choices(t_new)`;
2. `get_choices(t_old) âˆ– disc_choices` is a subset of `get_choices(t_new)`;
3. `get_choices(t_fwd)` is a subset of `get_choices(t_new)`.
4. `disc_choices` is  within the support of `bwd_proposal`

For valid posterior inference conditioned on prior observations, note that
`fwd_proposal` should not cause any of those observations to be discarded,
(i.e., `disc_choices` should not contain any `observations` given in previous
calls to `pf_update!`).

Similar functionality is provided by [`move_reweight`](@ref), except that
`pf_update!` also allows model arguments to be updated.
